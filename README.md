# Basic Calculator Program

A simple command-line calculator built in Python that performs basic arithmetic operations.

## Features

- Accepts two numbers from the user
- Supports four basic operations:
  - Addition (`+`)
  - Subtraction (`-`)
  - Multiplication (`*`)
  - Division (`/`)
- Handles invalid numeric input
- Prevents division by zero errors
- Provides user-friendly error messages

## How It Works

1. The user is prompted to enter the first number.
2. The user is prompted to enter the second number.
3. The user is asked to choose an operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, or `/`).
4. The calculator performs the chosen operation and displays the result.
5. If an invalid number or operation is entered, an appropriate error message is shown.
